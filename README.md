# Copilot example

## Inline suggestion

The fizzbuzz.py example

```python
# Fizzbuzz function that receives a parameter "number"
# If the number is divisible by 3, return "Fizz"
# If the number is divisible by 5, return "Buzz"
# But if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, return "FizzBuzz"
# Else, print the number
def fizzbuzz
```

Add code to run the function

## Generative example

### Setup python project with virtualenv

```can you give me give the bash commands to setup an virtualenv that can read the output from a REST API and output it to YAML?```

### Create test environment

Create docker compose with nginx that mount bind volume to ./html
```can you create a docker compose file that runs nginx and maps the html directory to the nginx html using a bind volume```

Refactor compose file to listen to port 8888
```can you refactor this compose file to listen to port 8888```

Create JSON test file
```can you create a json file named api without the .json extension with some test data in html/```

```you forgot to create the html directory first```

Run in other terminal

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Create simple python that fetches data from nginx

```generate python script to retrieve data from http://localhost:8888/api```

Document code

```/doc```

Refactor code to class

```can you refactor the code to a class```

### Create complex python example

Create a module that creates classes to fetch and process json data

(Open api file)

```considering the json {'name': 'Test', 'description': 'This is some test data.', 'numbers': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'person': {'firstName': 'John', 'lastName': 'Doe', 'age': 30}}, can you create a example that interprets the json data from <http://localhost:8888/api> with multiple classes in separate files and how to organize them in a python module named get_some_api_output```

```can you include the commands to create the files and folder structure?```

Refactor code to convert output to yaml

```can you refactor the code to convert the output to yaml```

Create unit test

```/tests```

Run pytest

```shell
pip install pytest
pytest
```
